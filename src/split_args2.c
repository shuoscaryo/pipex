/*	dup_str:
		Auxiliary function used in "get_word"
		Copies the word found in string "s" into string "out" ignoring

		character or '<' '>'.

		out: string where the word will be copied
		s: string where the word will be searched
		len: length of the word that will be copied
		c: delimiter character between words
	Return:
		The returned result is the "out" variable
	Code:
		Iterates until the string is over or the required characters have been
		written in "out".
		The loop works with states:
			-state 0: Means the read characters are outside quotes
			-state 1: Means the read characters are inside "" quotes
			-state 2: Means the read characters are inside '' quotes
		(state 1 and 2 are different because there can be opposite quotes
		inside)
		When in state 0, if any quote is found the state will change. The
		assignation is done like that to shorten the code. if s[i]=' the result
		is 2 and if s[i]=" the result is 1
		When in either state 1 or 2, if the same quotation type is found, state
		goes back to 0.
		In both state transitions, the iteration is skipped so the surrounding
		quotation characters don't get counted in the length.
		With every successful iteration the character is written in "out".
